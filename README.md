# ShowTime Manager

The goal of this project was to create an app with basic CRUD functionality that allows a venue to track the bands and artists playing there. 

I used Razor Pages and EF Core to create a simple form in which showtime info is input, including the artist name and genre, the price of admission, and the date of the show. Each entry can be updated or deleted. Users can filter the input data by genre or search by artist name.

#

## Project Requirements

1. Created a class and an object of that class, and populated it with data.

2. Created and called at least 3 functions/methods.

3. Created an additional class which inherits properties from its parent.

4. Implemented a regular expression.

5. Used a LINQ query to retreive information from a data structure.
